    <p>Hello and welcome to my about me page. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I love everything NYC. I have
        been to over 20 different countries and I still believe in my heart that NYC is the best city in the world. A
        little
        bit about me, I am an Electronics junkie. I love all sorts of tech gadgets. I am a huge sports fan. My favorite
        sports
        teams are The Yankees, The Giants, and The Nets. I'm also a cigar aficianado. I enjoy being around friends and
        family. I'm also into power lifting and I hope someday to actually have time to do it competitively. I'm a
        huge Hip Hop fan and I hope and pray that someday it will be as good as it was back on the late 90's and early
        2000's.</p>

    <p>Professionally, I am an Electronics Technician. I currently work for CW Services, which contracts with Amazon to
        maintain their Material Handling Equipment. Although, I do enjoy my profession, I have decided to transition
        into Computer Science, which is the reason why I came back to school. I plan to earn a BS in Computer Science
        and work in either Software Development or Cyber Security. </p>
